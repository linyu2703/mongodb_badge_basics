# Questions
- Relational databases like MySQL store data in structured tables with fixed schemas and use JOINs (INNER, OUTER, LEFT, RIGHT) to create relations between data across tables. In contrast, document databases like MongoDB store flexible, JSON-like documents that can embed related data, reducing the need for complex joins.
- One scenario where using a non-SQL database like MongoDB would be appropriate, like at Southampton Hospital, MongoDB could be used to store patient electronic health records (EHRs) that include diverse data types like lab results, imaging reports, patient informations, and doctor notes which can all vary in structure between patients. Its flexible schema allows for easy updates and integration of new data types without disrupting existing records, this streamlines data analysis and reporting workflow.
